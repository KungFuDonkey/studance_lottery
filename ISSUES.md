# What is the order
1. We first assign everyone their first preference for every group, then second for every group, etc. This practically places the last group first preference in front of the first group second preference
2. We assign first preference within the group, then second preference within the group then third etc. This places teh first preference of anyone above the second preference of anyone
3. We shuffle all participants within the group, then assign the best preference per person In this case the shuffle determines who has a higher chance of being elected. This has an issue when following the advice of the teacher, as that being the second choice suddenly should be at a higher priority than someone who is not following the advice
For now assign every priority group, within each choice list first pick the choices that align with Teachers suggestions

# Fifth group are students that were not rolled in last year (must be new?)
